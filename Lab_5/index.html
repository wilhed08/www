        <h1>Welcome to Wilmer's Website!</h1>
        <p>My name is Wilmer Torres, I was born in Colombia and I am 37 years old. I have been living in Sault Ste. Marie for two months now. I am married and I have two children who are in Colombia. They will be traveling to Canada next December 4th. I am studying computer programming at Sault College because I am passionate about software development.</p>
        <p>I like to practice some sports such as soccer, basketball, volleyball, etc. I also like to play video games. I love English music and my favorite band is Gun's Roses. I enjoy spending my free time with my family and getting to know new places. I am very cheerful and I like to dance to different types of Latin music.</p>
